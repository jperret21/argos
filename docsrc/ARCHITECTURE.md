# ARGOS — Architecture

*A differential-photometry controller for the ZWO Seestar S30 Pro — about
33 kLoC in three layers (core 14.0k, ui 16.4k, workers 2.7k).*

```{admonition} The section markers in this document
:class: note

Cross-references written as `§n` — `(§6 C1)` and the like — point into `notes/photometry_plan.md`, the
project's internal working spec. It is in the repository but deliberately not
published here, so those markers are for someone reading the source tree, not
for this website.
```

```{seealso}
{doc}`api/index` documents every module from its docstrings.
{doc}`differential_photometry` covers what the photometry layer computes, and
{doc}`seestar_protocol` the wire format underneath the driver layer.
```

## Why This Exists

The Seestar S30 Pro is a capable little astrograph — 160 mm f/5.3 quadruplet APO,
IMX585 (Starvis 2), 3840×2160 at 2.9 µm. But its native app treats it as an
eyepiece replacement, not a science instrument. ARGOS fills the gap:

- **ASCOM Alpaca** for all hardware control (telescope, camera, focuser, filter wheel)
- **Differential photometry pipeline** — from raw GRBG mosaic to ensemble light curve
- **AAVSO-ready** — VSX/VSP catalogue queries, TG-band photometry, Siril-compatible
  folder structure
- **Live preview with scientific tools** — HFD metrics, plate solving, multi-star
  aperture photometry, all off the UI thread

The Seestar hardware constraints are real: 2.9 µm pixels, 3.74″/pixel scale,
~4.6° FOV, 55 °C thermal veto, and a WiFi bottleneck that makes a full-frame
download take ~5 s. Every design decision below respects those limits.

## Layer Map

Three layers, one dependency direction. This is the core architectural invariant:

```

```

```{important}
**The arrows above are not all one-way, and the diagram used to claim they
were.** Stating it accurately, as of 0.4.1:

| Rule | Status | Audit |
|---|---|---|
| `core` must not import Qt | **holds**, with one documented exception | `grep -rn PyQt6 argos/core/` → 2 hits |
| `workers` must not import widgets | **holds** | `grep -rn "QtWidgets\|QtGui" argos/workers/` → 0 hits |
| `ui` must not do network I/O | **holds** | `grep -rn "requests\|socket\|urllib" argos/ui/` → 0 hits |
| `ui` must reach `core` only through `workers` | **does not hold** | `grep -rn "from argos.core" argos/ui/` → ~62 hits across 28 modules |
| `core` must not import `ui` or `workers` | **holds** | `grep -rn "argos.ui\|argos.workers" argos/core/` → 0 hits |

The `ui → core` edge is pervasive and mostly legitimate: the interface calls
Qt-free pure functions directly — `imaging.stretch`, `imaging.metrics`,
`photometry.airmass`, `exoplanet.transit` and the like — rather than paying a
thread hop for a microsecond of arithmetic. What `workers` exists for is
anything **blocking**: network, disk, plate solving, long frame maths. Read the
rule as *"nothing that can block reaches core from the UI thread"*, not as
*"the UI never imports core"*.

None of this is enforced by a linter. The five greps above are, between them, a
complete audit; running them in CI would be worth more than this paragraph.
```

The Qt exception under `core/`: `acquisition_engine.py` and `device_session.py`
import `QObject`/`pyqtSignal` because they own the acquisition lifecycle and
emit signals directly. Everything else under `core/` — all frame maths,
photometry, catalogues and protocol clients — is genuinely Qt-free and
headless-testable.

## Complete Module Map

### `core/` — Python, Qt-free outside `session/`

All frame maths, network protocols, catalogues, and science logic live here.

## Communication Protocols

### ASCOM Alpaca — HTTP REST (port **32323**)

The primary control channel. Every hardware operation goes through this:

```
http://<device>:32323/api/v1/<device_type>/<index>/<property|method>
```

| Device        | Index | Purpose                            |
|---------------|-------|------------------------------------|
| Telescope     | 0     | Slew, track, park, MoveAxis        |
| Camera        | 0     | IMX585 science camera              |
| Focuser       | 0     | Telephoto focuser                  |
| Focuser       | 1     | Wide-angle focuser (addressable, unused)   |
| FilterWheel   | 0     | Dark(0) / IR(1) / LP(2)            |

**Port note.** The Alpaca server is on **32323**; 4700 is the native JSON-RPC
port. `config.py` defaults to 32323.

MoveAxis — reported broken in earlier firmware — works correctly on 7.18+.
Use it for all manual jogging; the native JSON-RPC path is no longer needed.

**Image download.** Two paths exist:
- *Fast:* binary `ImageBytes` buffer (~3 s for 8.3 MPx)
- *Fallback:* JSON `ImageArray` (~33 s, used when binary dimensions mismatch)

The wrapper in `core/alpaca/camera.py` detects the mismatch and falls back
transparently, logging which path was taken.

### Native JSON-RPC — TCP (port 4700)

Retained exclusively for `scope_speed_move` jogging on firmware where MoveAxis
was broken (pre-7.18). On current firmware this port accepts TCP but returns
no response — the ZWO native app may hold an exclusive lock.

Keep-alive: send `scope_get_equ_coord` every 10 s or the Seestar closes the
connection (BrokenPipe on next command).

### Stellarium Telescope Protocol — TCP (port 10001)

Asyncio server speaking the v1.0 binary protocol. Lets Stellarium drive the
Seestar mount as a standard telescope. The binary codec is in
`core/stellarium/protocol.py`; the asyncio event loop runs on a QThread via
`workers/stellarium_worker.py`.

### Device Discovery

`core/alpaca/discovery.py` tries three layers, in this order:

1. **Alpaca UDP broadcast** on port 32227 — the standard mechanism. Fast when it
   works; silently swallowed by phone hotspots and isolated access points.
2. **Direct HTTP probe** of the last-used host, then `10.0.0.1` (access-point
   mode):
   ```
   GET http://<ip>:32323/management/v1/configureddevices
   ```
   A candidate is accepted on a 2xx response whose body parses as JSON. The
   device *count* is not checked — the Seestar exposes five device endpoints,
   and no code anywhere asserts a number.
3. **TCP sweep of the local /24**, confirming each candidate against the same
   management endpoint.

So discovery works on networks that drop broadcasts; it just takes longer. The
observer-facing version of this is in {doc}`field_connectivity`.

## Threading Model

```
┌─ Main thread ──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Qt event loop. Never blocks. Never does I/O.           │
│  Receives signals from workers, updates widgets.        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ▲ signals ▲                ▲ signals ▲
         │         │                │         │
┌────────┴─────────┴──┐   ┌────────┴─────────┴──┐
│  QThread (long-lived)│   │  QThread (per-task) │
│  • exposure_worker   │   │  • solve_worker     │
│  • polling_worker    │   │  • catalog_worker   │
│  • sequence_worker   │   │  • autofocus_worker │
│  • stellarium_worker │   │  • exoplanet_worker │
└──────────────────────┘   └─────────────────────┘

The right-hand column is *not* a `QThreadPool`: those are ordinary `QThread`s
created per task and reaped on completion. `QThreadPool.globalInstance()` is
used at three call sites, all under `core/session/`:
`acquisition_engine.py:1559` (an anonymous `QRunnable` for asynchronous FITS
writing), and `device_session.py:641` and `:653`, which run the named
`_JogRunnable` and `_FilterMoveRunnable`.
```

### The preview chain (three threads, latest-frame-wins)

```{graphviz} diagrams/preview_chain.dot
:align: center
```

1. **LivePreviewWorker** (QThread, in `exposure_worker.py`) starts the camera exposure via Alpaca HTTP, polls
   `ImageReady`, and downloads the raw uint16 array.
2. **PreviewProcessor** (QThread) receives the raw array via the `frame_ready` signal
   and computes the display render, star field, frame metrics, and histograms — all
   off the UI thread.
3. The **UI thread** receives a `ProcessedFrame` dataclass and applies the final
   display stretch, overlays, and histogram update. These are cheap enough
   (numpy uint8 → QImage) to run on the main thread.

**Latest-frame-wins.** If frames arrive faster than `PreviewProcessor` can
process them, stale jobs are silently dropped. The processor keeps only the
most recently submitted `(raw, view)` and skips any intermediate ones.

This is the single most important performance architecture in the app.
Without it, a 5-second image download would freeze the UI. With it, the
preview stays responsive even when the camera is dumping frames faster
than the display can consume them.

## Sequence Execution

One plan becomes a stream of frames through `expand_plan()`, and
`workers/sequence_worker.py` runs each one through the same six steps:

```{graphviz} diagrams/sequence_execution.dot
```

Autofocus runs on a filter change or every *N* frames, whichever the plan asks
for; the exposure step polls `ImageReady` rather than blocking; and the FITS
write is handed to a `QRunnable` so the next frame can start immediately.

## Data Flow — End to End

## Photometry Pipeline (Preview)

This runs live during an acquisition session — no calibration frames, no
post-processing. The publishable pipeline (darks, flats, bias) runs later
in Siril or a separate reduction script.

From a selected star to an exported row, the call chain is:

```{graphviz} diagrams/photometry_pipeline.dot
```

What each stage computes — and what it leaves out — is in
{doc}`differential_photometry`.

```

    │
    ▼
photometry/differential.py ──► ensemble differential magnitudes
    │
    ▼

```

Each module is unit-testable in isolation. The full chain runs off the UI
thread through the acquisition engine, ASTAP/catalog workers and the batch
photometry worker; the live window only renders the resulting measurements.

## Configuration

File: `~/.argos/config.json`

Key sections:

| Path | Key | Default | Notes |
|------|-----|---------|-------|
| `alpaca` | `host` / `port` | `""` / `32323` | One device IP address and Alpaca port; discovery fills the same endpoint |
| `sessions_path` | — | `~/Argos/sessions/` | Output; Siril-compatible layout |
| `observer` | `name` / `obscode` | empty | FITS observer identity and AAVSO export code |
| `site` | `name` / `latitude` / `longitude` / `elevation` / `favorites` | empty / 0 | FITS site metadata, visibility and airmass/Moon geometry |
| `camera` | `adc_bits` / `full_well_adu` | 12 / 60000 | **Deprecated** — migrated to the telescope profile on first load; kept so an older ARGOS can still read the file |
| `astrometry` | `astap_path` / `database_path` / `database` | `""` / `""` / `""` | ASTAP executable, optional star-database folder and database set |
| `catalog` | `mag_limit` / `max_results` | 15.0 / 250 | VSX cone search bounds |
| `photometry` | `aperture_fwhm_mult` / etc. | 2.5 / ... | Aperture radii in FWHM units |
| `diagnostics` | `enabled` | `false` | Optional local per-frame JSONL diagnostics; never uploaded |

## Session Layout (Siril-Compatible)

Written by `core/imaging/fits_writer.py`. The folder names, the filename pattern
and all 65 header keywords are specified in one place — {doc}`fits_headers` —
and that page is generated against the writer. **Do not duplicate them here**: a
second copy of this layout drifted out of date once already and contradicted the
writer in every field.

In brief: `{RUN}_{OBJECT}/` at the top, lower-case plural `lights/ darks/
flats/ biases/` beneath it as Siril expects, `.fit` files with no timestamp in
the name, plus `session.json`, `photometry_quality.json` and `diagnostics/`.

## Key Constants (from Hardware)

| Quantity | Value | Source |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Focal length | 160 mm | seevar hardware docs |
| Aperture | f/5.3 | 160 / 30.0 mm |
| Sensor | Sony IMX585 (Starvis 2) | — |
| Bayer pattern | **GRBG** (not RGGB) | critical for photometry |
| Pixel size | 2.9 µm | IMX585 datasheet |
| Resolution | 3840 × 2160 | 8.3 MPx |
| Pixel scale | 3.74″/px | 206.265 × 2.9 / 160 |
| Field of view | 3.99° × 2.24° (4.58° diagonal) | `hardware/profile.py` `fov_deg` |
| Saturation flag | `camera.linearity_max_adu`, 50 000 ADU | **not reconciled with `EGAIN`/`FULLWELL`** — see {doc}`differential_photometry` §3.5 |
| AAVSO filter code | TG | untransformed Bayer green |

```{warning}
Earlier revisions of this table quoted a 4.6° field of view and a "55 °C thermal
veto". The first was the *diagonal* presented as the width; the second describes
software that does not exist — nothing in `argos/` compares a temperature
against a threshold. See {doc}`seestar_protocol` §12.
