"""Comparison-star selection for differential photometry (Qt-free).

Given a variable star (the target) and the field's VSP comparison stars, rank the
comparisons for photometry of that target. The standard differential-photometry
criteria are: comparisons **close** to the target (same region of the chip, same
airmass/vignetting) and of **similar brightness**. VSP already guarantees they
are non-variable and calibrated, so this module just scores + orders them.
